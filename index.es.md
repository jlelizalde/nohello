# Por favor, no digas simplemente 'Hola'

<pre>
2010-07-19 12:32:12 tú: Hola
2010-07-19 12:32:15 Compañero: Hola.
# TU COMPAÑERO ESPERA MIENTRAS TÚ PREPARAS TU PREGUNTA
2010-07-19 12:34:01 tú: Estoy trabajando en [algo] y estoy tratando de hacer [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:35:21 compañero: Oh, eso [respuesta...]
</pre>

Es como si al hablar con alguien por teléfono lo saludas con un "¡Hola!" y luego lo pusieras en espera.

Mejor, haz lo siguiente:

<pre>
2010-07-19 12:32:12 tú: ¡Hola! -- Estoy trabajando en [algo] y estoy tratando de hacer lo siguiente [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:33:32 compañero: [Responde pregunta]
</pre>

Nota que de esta manera obtienes una respuesta mucho más pronto y no lo haces esperar. 
En vez de ello, tu compañero puede empezar a pensar de inmediato en la pregunta que le formulaste.

You're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you
would do in person or on the phone. But Chat is neither of those things. Typing
is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making the
other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity.

The same goes for "Hello -- Are you there?", "Hi Bob -- quick question.", "Do
you have a sec ?", "yt?" and "ping". Just ask the question!

If you feel it's brusque to simply say "Hi" and ask the question, you can do
something like this:

<pre>
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- if you're not busy I was wondering if I could ask a question. I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
</pre>

Additionally, asking your question before getting a reply allows asynchronous
communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back,
they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and
wondering what they missed.

Some people like to probe with an initial "hello" to verify whether the presence
status shown is true, hoping they can determine whether the recipient is near a device,
then will immediately follow up with a call. Don't do that either.
If someone is able and willing to answer a chat message, it does not mean that they are also available for
a voice or video call.

Instead of sending a call probe, or asking "hey, do you have time for a call?"
(which is better but not great), you can try something like this:

<pre>
2020-07-08 12:32:12 you: Hi - do you have X min for a quick call to talk about XYZ? [etc...]
</pre>

This does three things: it time bounds the request, it gives the recipient some context, and
it helps you remember what you wanted to talk about if the recipient can't or doesn't respond
until later.
